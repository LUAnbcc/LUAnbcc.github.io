                            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                            <p>By using our services, you agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>
                            <p>The total amount is due for the rental of the radio communication equipment as set out in the invoice.
                                Payment is due in full prior to the end date listed above, with at least 50% received prior to the start date listed above unless otherwise agreed.
                                Payment can be made by bank transfer only, unless otherwise agreed.				
                                Please quote the Invoice Number as a reference.
                                The customer assumes full responsibility for the rented radio communication equipment from the date of delivery/collection until returned.
                                In the event of any loss, damage (beyond reasonable wear and tear), or theft of the rented equipment, the customer shall be liable for the full cost of repair or replacement at current market value.
                                It is recommended that hirers take out appropriate insurance to cover the costs of lost, damaged or stolen equipment.
                                Overdue invoices may be subject to a late payment fee.
                                The rented equipment must be returned to Event Medical Radio Solutions on or before the agreed return date in the condition it was received, subject to reasonable wear and tear.
                                Failure to return the equipment on time may result in additional rental charges.
                                Arrangements for collection and return of equipment must be made in advance.
                                Equipment may be upgraded due to availability of items.
                                </p>
                                <p>Please note that Event Medical Radio Solutions is not responsible for any loss or damage as a result of the rented equipment.</p>
